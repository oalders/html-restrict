NAME
    HTML::Restrict - Strip unwanted HTML tags and attributes

VERSION
    version 1.0.2

SYNOPSIS
    This module uses *HTML::Parser* to strip HTML from text in a restrictive
    manner. By default all HTML is restricted. You may alter the default
    behaviour by supplying your own tag rules.

        use HTML::Restrict;

        my $hr = HTML::Restrict->new();

        # use default rules to start with (strip away all HTML)
        my $processed = $hr->process('  <b>i am bold</b>  ');

        # $processed now equals: 'i am bold'

        # Now, a less restrictive example:
        ##################################

        use HTML::Restrict;

        my $hr = HTML::Restrict->new();
        $hr->set_rules({
            b   => [],
            img => [qw( src alt / )]
        });

        my $html = q[<body><b>hello</b> <img src="pic.jpg" alt="me" id="test" /></body>];
        my $processed = $hr->process( $html );

        # $processed now equals: <b>hello</b> <img src="pic.jpg" alt="me" />

CONSTRUCTOR AND STARTUP
  new()
    Creates and returns a new HTML::Restrict object.

        my $hr = HTML::Restrict->new()

    HTML::Restrict doesn't require any params to be passed to new. If your
    goal is to remove all HTML from text, then no further setup is required.
    Just pass your text to the process() method and you're done:

        my $plain_text = $hr->process( $html );

    If you need to set up specific rules, have a look at the params which
    HTML::Restrict recognizes:

    *   "rules => \%rules"

        Rules should be passed as a HASHREF of allowed tags. Each hash value
        should represent the allowed attributes for the listed tag. For
        example, if you want to allow a fair amount of HTML, you can try
        something like this:

            my %rules = (
                a       => [qw( href target )],
                b       => [],
                caption => [],
                center  => [],
                em      => [],
                i       => [],
                img     => [qw( alt border height width src style / )],
                li      => [],
                ol      => [],
                p       => [qw(style)],
                span    => [qw(style)],
                strong  => [],
                sub     => [],
                sup     => [],
                table   => [qw( style border cellspacing cellpadding align )],
                tbody   => [],
                td      => [],
                tr      => [],
                u       => [],
                ul      => [],
            );

            my $hr = HTML::Restrict->new( rules => \%rules )

        Or, to allow only bolded text:

            my $hr = HTML::Restrict->new( rules => { b => [] } );

        Allow bolded text, images and some (but not all) image attributes:

            my %rules = (
                b   => [ ],
                img => [qw( src alt width height border / )
            );
            my $hr = HTML::Restrict->new( rules => \%rules );

        Since *HTML::Parser* treats a closing slash as an attribute, you'll
        need to add "/" to your list of allowed attributes if you'd like
        your tags to retain closing slashes. For example:

            my $hr = HTML::Restrict->new( rules =>{ hr => [] } );
            $hr->process( "<hr />"); # returns: <hr>

            my $hr = HTML::Restrict->new( rules =>{ hr => [qw( / )] } );
            $hr->process( "<hr />"); # returns: <hr />

        HTML::Restrict strips away any tags and attributes which are not
        explicitly allowed. It also rebuilds your explicitly allowed tags
        and places their attributes in the order in which they appear in
        your rules.

        So, if you define the following rules:

            my %rules = (
                ...
                img => [qw( src alt title width height id / )]
                ...
            );

        then your image tags will all be built like this:

            <img src=".." alt="..." title="..." width="..." height="..." id=".." />

        This gives you greater consistency in your tag layout. If you don't
        care about element order you don't need to pay any attention to
        this, but you should be aware that your elements are being
        reconstructed rather than just stripped down.

    *   "trim => [0|1]"

        By default all leading and trailing spaces will be removed when text
        is processed. Set this value to 0 in order to disable this
        behaviour.

        For example, to preserve leading and trailing whitespace:

            $hr->trim( 0 );
            my $trimmed = $hr->process('  <b>i am bold</b>  ');

            # $trimmed now equals: '  i am bold  '

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
  process( $html )
    This is the method which does the real work. It parses your data,
    removes any tags and attributes which are not specifically allowed and
    returns the resulting text. Requires and returns a SCALAR.

  get_rules
    An accessor method, which returns a HASHREF of allowed tags and their
    allowed attributes. Returns an empty HASHREF by default, since the
    default behaviour is to disallow all HTML.

  set_rules( \%rules )
    Sets the rules which will be used to process your data. By default all
    HTML tags are off limits. Use this method to define the HTML elements
    and corresponding attributes you'd like to use.

    If you only need to set rules once, you might want to pass them to the
    new() method when constructing the object, but you may also set your
    rules using set_rules(). If you want to apply different rules to
    different data without creating a new object each time, set_rules() will
    handle changing the object's behaviour for you.

    Please note that set_rules is a mutator method, so your changes are not
    cumulative. The last rules passed to the set_rules method are the rules
    which will be applied to your data when it is processed.

    For example:

        # create object which allows only a and img tags
        my $hr = HTML::Restrict->new( rules => { a => [ ...], img => [ ... ] } );

        # return to defaults (no HTML allowed)
        $hr->set_rules({});

  trim( 0|1 )
    By default all leading and trailing spaces will be removed when text is
    processed. Set this value to 0 in order to disable this behaviour.

MOTIVATION
    There are already several modules on the CPAN which accomplish much of
    the same thing, but after doing a lot of poking around, I was unable to
    find a solution with a simple setup which I was happy with.

    The most common use case might be stripping HTML from user submitted
    data completely or allowing just a few tags and attributes to be
    displayed. This module doesn't do any validation on the actual content
    of the tags or attributes. If this is a requirement, you can either mess
    with the parser object, post-process the text yourself or have a look at
    one of the more feature-rich modules in the SEE ALSO section below.

    My aim here is to keep things easy and, hopefully, cover a lot of the
    less complex use cases with just a few lines of code and some brief
    documentation. The idea is to be up and running quickly.
